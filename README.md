Hi. Welcome in <b>Dark Dust</b>.<br>
This is my FIRST solo game project, where I am trying create board game called Forbidden Desert. As I wrote, this is my first project and I am aware that many approaches in the code are not properly chosen... but, I am trying my best you know. This game will by completly free and can by played with steam support networking I hope. Pictures in game is from random google searching, and I don't have any copyright license so it is completly free. 
So, it is only project of fan of Forbidden desert.
